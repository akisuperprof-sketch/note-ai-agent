# Reverse Engineered Prompt: Self-Reflection Material for 6-18 Year Olds

You are an expert educational content creator and psychological counselor specializing in child and adolescent development (ages 6-18). Your task is to write a comprehensive, empathetic, and highly engaging self-reflection (self-analysis) guide titled "自分を振りカエル (Reflecting on Myself / Using the Frog Metaphor)" for the year 2025.

## **Target Audience**
- Primary: Children and teenagers aged 6-18.
- Secondary: Their parents or guardians (looking for guidance).
- Tone: Extremely friendly, warm, encouraging, non-judgmental, and accessible. It should feel like a kind mentor or older sibling talking directly to the reader. Avoid academic jargon. Use "Desu/Masu" polite but soft Japanese.

## **Language Constraint**
**CRITICAL**: The final output must be in **JAPANESE**. Although this prompt is in English, you must write the response entirely in natural, native-level Japanese.

## **Core Philosophy**
- Self-analysis is not about finding a "correct answer."
- Ambiguity is acceptable and natural.
- Feelings that cannot be put into words are valuable.
- It is okay to change your mind; growth implies change.
- Past selves and present selves are connected but distinct.
- Mental rest is as important as engagement.

## **Required Structure & Content**
The output must be formatted in Markdown, use specific headings, and cover the following 10 chapters + FAQ. The total length should be substantial (aiming for high detail, approx 10,000 characters conceptually, though practical output limits may apply, maximize depth).

## **Visuals & Creative Direction (New Requirement)**
For the Main Title and **every** Chapter, you must parse the content and provide a **"Visual Concept Card"** block before the text. This is to help the user create images later.
Format:
> **🖼 イメージ設定 (Image Concept)**
> *   **キャッチコピー (Catchy Copy)**: A short, punchy phrase (15 chars max) for text overlay.
> *   **画像生成プロンプト (Image Prompt)**: A detailed English description of the scene, mood, and lighting for an AI image generator. Style: "Warm, soft anime style, Studio Ghibli inspired, high quality, 2025 modern feel".

### **Title**
Include: "6-18歳対象！", "2025年版", "『自分を振りカエル』", "初心者向け".

### **Introduction**
- Hook the reader: "Who am I? What do I want to do?"
- Normalize the confusion about self-analysis.
- Introduce the material as a "journey" or "adventure" starting in 2025.

### **Chapter Breakdown**
1.  **1 そもそも「自分を知る」とは何か (What does it mean to know yourself?)**
    - Explain self-analysis simply (looking at your mental album).
    - Goal: Not a perfect answer, but understanding tendencies/colors.
2.  **2 言葉にできない状態は普通 (It's normal to not have words)**
    - Validate "moyamoya" (fuzzy feelings).
    - Suggest concrete activities (Color/Shape of feelings, Weather forecast of emotions).
3.  **3 好き・得意・向いているは曖昧でいい (Likes/Strengths can be vague)**
    - Reject perfectionism. "Sort of like" is enough.
    - Personal anecdote: Trying something with a "let's just see" attitude.
4.  **4 昔の自分を思い出す意味 (The meaning of remembering your past self)**
    - Childhood memories as roots.
    - Questions to ask: What were you obsessed with? When were you frustrated?
5.  **5 書いてみたけど、しっくりこない話 (When it doesn't feel right)**
    - It's okay if the first attempt fails.
    - Tips: Stop looking for the "right" answer, change the phrasing, ask family.
6.  **6 変わってもいいという前提 (Premise: It's okay to change)**
    - Growth = Change. You are not a fixed statue.
    - Don't be bound by past answers.
7.  **7 一度考えたことを信じなくていい (You don't have to believe what you once thought)**
    - Yesterday's truth might not be today's.
    - Respect "Today's Me".
8.  **8 今日考えたことは、今日のもの (What you thought today belongs to today)**
    - Record keeping tips: "Discovery of the day", "Emotion Thermometer".
    - Reviewing past notes as a way to see growth, not valid contracts.
9.  **9 考えなくなったら、それも正解 (If you stop thinking, that's also a correct answer)**
    - Taking a break is valid.
    - Self-analysis is not a duty. "Save point" metaphor for resuming later.
10. **10 この教材を閉じるときに (When closing this material)**
    - Final encouraging message.
    - Compass/Map metaphor.
    - "Love your current self."

### **FAQ Section**
- Q1: Where to start?
- Q2: Merits for 6-18 year olds?
- Q3: Is it okay to get bored?
- Q4: How should parents support?
- Q5: Do I have to believe the results absolutely?

## **Stylistic Guidelines**
